# Clipboard Clear

This script sets up a scheduled task to clear the clipboard every X minutes (user configurable). It uses no external software, only builtin OS commands, so it is suitable for secure environments. It can be run without admin, but admin is required if you want to set it as a background task to avoid the brief command window flash you will see otherwise. 

## Roadmap

- Implement Bash for Linux/MacOS
