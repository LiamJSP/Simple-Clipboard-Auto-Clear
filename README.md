# Clipboard Clear

This is simply a script that executes builtin operating system commands to schedule clipboard clearing - set a custom clear frequency to protect sensitive or confidential information. It requires no external software or OS changes, and has a no-admin mode for regular users, making this suitable for secure environments.

The script contains code to request Admin if the user chooses the option to schedule the keyboard clearing as a background task.
## Roadmap

- Implement Bash for Linux/MacOS
